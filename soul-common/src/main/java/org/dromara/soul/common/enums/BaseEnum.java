 * An enum needs to be represented by both K and V, if you only use One of them, maybe you can define them as the same type.
 * @param <V> T should be defined to describe the intent of this enumeration, like description, introduce.
 * @param <K> You should define C to represent this enumerationï¼Œlike code, key, name.
